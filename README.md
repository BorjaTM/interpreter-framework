# Lox Interpreter in Java

## 📘 About the Project

This is a personal learning project focused on building a simple interpreter in Java. It follows the structure and concepts introduced in the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom, using the Lox programming language as a reference.

The goal is to understand how interpreters work by implementing each stage of the language pipeline, including:

- Lexical analysis (scanning)
- Syntax analysis (parsing)
- Expression evaluation
- Variable and environment management
- Control flow and function execution

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 11+
- Maven for build automation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:BorjaTM/interpreter-framework.git
